This is the open source release of Cherry Tomatoes, a Pebble application using the
Rotten Tomatoes API to give information about current and upcoming movies.

For security reasons, the API key for Rotten Tomatoes is NOT stored in the source
code repository.  If you're building your own version, you'll need to modify the
phone.js file and add your own API_KEY in the line near the top setting this
global variable.
